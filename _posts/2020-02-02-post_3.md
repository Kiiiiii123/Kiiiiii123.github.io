### CS285 Lecture2: Supervised Learning of Behaviors
### (1) Today’s Lecture
#### 1. Definition of sequential decision problems
#### 2. Imitation learning: supervised learning for decision making
##### • Does direct imitation work?
##### • How can we make it work more often?
#### 3. A little bit of theory
#### 4. Case studies of recent work in (deep) imitation learning
#### 5. Goals:
##### • Understand definitions & notation
##### • Understand basic imitation learning algorithms
##### • Understand tools for theoretical analysis
### (2) Terminology & notation

### (3) graphical model
#### 1. Observation is produced from the state
#### 2.
### (4) End-to-end learning means a lot for sequential decision making 
### (5) Deep models are what allow reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex problems end to end!
### (6) Why should we study this now?
#### 1. Advances in deep learning
#### 2. Advances in reinforcement learning
#### 3. Advances in computational capability
