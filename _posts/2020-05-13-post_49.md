### Paper 25: Acme: A Research Framework for Distributed Reinforcement Learning

#### Github: <https://github.com/deepmind/acme>.

### Abstract

- #### We introduce Acme, a tool to simplify the development of novel RL algorithms that is specifically designed to enable simple agent implementations that can be run at various scales of execution.


- #### Our aim is also to make the results of various RL algorithms developed in academia and industrial labs easier to reproduce and extend. 

- #### To this end we are releasing baseline implementations of various algorithms, created using our framework. In this work we introduce the major design decisions behind Acme and show how these are used to construct these baselines.

- #### We also experiment with these agents at different scales of both complexity and computation—including distributed versions. Ultimately, we show that the design decisions behind Acme lead to agents that can be scaled both up and down and that, for the most part, greater levels of parallelization result in agents with equivalent performance, just faster.

### 1 Introduction

#### A characteristic of much of recent RL research has been an integrationist（整合主义）perspective on agent design, involving the `combination of various algorithmic components`. Agents may incorporate ideas such as intrinsic rewards and auxiliary（辅助的）tasks, ensembling, prioritized experience replay, distributional backups, specialized neural network architectures, policy improvement search methods, learning from demonstrations, variance reduction, hierarchy or meta-learning, to name a few examples. This has led to many state-of-the-art agents incorporating numerous heterogeneous（多样化的）components, contributing to their increased complexity and to growing concerns about the reproducibility of research.

#### Widespread use of increasingly large-scale distributed systems in RL agent training introduces numerous engineering and algorithmic challenges, and relies on significant amounts of infrastructure which can impede（阻止）the reproducibility of research. It also motivates agent designs that may represent dramatic departures from canonical abstractions laid out in the reinforcement learning literature. This often means that `“scaling up” from a simple, single-process prototype of an algorithm to a full distributed system may require a reimplementation of the agent`.

#### `Acme is a software library and light-weight framework for expressing and training RL agents which attempts to address both the issues of complexity and scale within a unified framework, allowing for fast iteration of research ideas and scalable implementation of state-of-the-art agents`. Acme does this by providing tools and components for constructing agents at various levels of abstraction, from the lowest (e.g. networks, losses, policies) through to workers (actors, learners, replay buffers), and finally entire agents complete with the experimental apparatus（装置）necessary for robust measurement and evaluation, such as training loops, logging, and checkpointing. The agents written in the framework are state-of-the-art implementations that promote the use of common tools and components, hopefully leading to common community benchmarks. Our modular design of Acme’s agents makes them easily scalable to large distributed systems, all while maintaining clear and straightforward abstractions and simultaneously supporting training in the non-distributed setting.

#### In what remains of this section, we give `a brief overview of modern RL` and discuss `various software frameworks used to tackle such problems`.

#### 1.1 Modern Reinforcement Learning

#### Agent has to master two formidable challenges which align with the actor and learner processes. `First, an agent must explore its environment effectively so as to obtain useful experiences. Second, it has to learn effectively from these experiences`. 

#### `In online RL, both challenges are attacked simultaneously`. As a result, vast numbers of interactions are often required to learn policies represented as DNNs. The need for data of this magnitude motivates the use of distributed agents as described above with `many parallel actors`. This is particularly important in simulated environments and games where massive amounts of experience can be gathered in a distributed manner and at rates substantially faster than real-time. At the other end of the spectrum lies `offline RL—also known as batch RL—which focuses on the challenge of learning policies from a fixed dataset of experiences`. This situation arises often in settings where online experimentation is impossible or impractical, e.g. industrial control and healthcare. Frequently, the goal of this setting is to `learn a policy that outperforms those used to generate the dataset of past experiences`. Of course there is also a great deal of work in between these two extremes, which is where most of the work on `off-policy agents` lies.

#### `Acme is designed to greatly simplify the construction of agents in each of these settings`. In Section 2 we introduce natural modules to the design of agents which correspond to the acting, dataset, and learning components. These allow us to tackle simple, classical on- and off-policy agents by combining all of the above in a synchronous setting. We can also separate the acting and learning components and replicate the actor processes to arrive at modern, distributed agents. And by removing acting completely and making use of a fixed dataset we can tackle the offline RL setting directly. Finally, in order to exemplify this split we will also detail in Section 3 a number of example learning components built using Acme and show how these can be combined to arrive at different algorithms.

#### `The design philosophy behind Acme is to strike a balance between simplicity and that of modularity and scale`. This is often a difficult target to hit—often it is much easier to lean heavily into one and neglect the other. Instead, in Acme we have designed a framework and collection of agents that can be easily modified and experimented with at small scales, or expanded to high levels of data throughput at the other end of the spectrum. While we are focusing for the moment on releasing the single-process variants of these agents, the design philosophy behind the large-scale distributed versions remains the same.

### 2 Acme

#### Acme is a library and framework for building readable, efficient, research-oriented RL algorithms. `At its core Acme is designed to enable simple descriptions of RL agents that can be run at many different scales of execution`. While this usually culminates in running many separate (parallel) acting and learning processes in one large distributed system; we first describe Acme in a simpler, single-process setting, where acting and learning are perfectly synchronized. A key feature of Acme is that `the agents can be run in both the single-process and highly distributed regimes using the exact same modules or building blocks with very limited differences`. We achieve this by factoring the code into components that make sense at both ends of the scale. In what remains of this section we will `discuss several of these components and how they interact`. 

#### 2.1 Environments, actors, and environment loops

#### Acme assumes that the environment adheres to the dm_env.Environment interface. However, readers familiar with the dm_env.TimeStep interface, may notice that we’ve deliberately（故意地）omitted（遗漏）the environmental discount factor to simplify notation, as it often simply takes binary values to signal the end of an episode.

#### In Acme, the component that interacts most closely with the environment is the actor.

#### The interaction between an actor and its environment is mediated by an environment loop. Custom loops can easily be implemented but we provide `a generic one` that meets most of our needs and provides a simple entry point for interacting with any of the actors or agents implemented within Acme.

#### This following figure shows the pseudocode and includes a (slightly simplified) example of Acme’s implementation of this loop. one of the key design goals of Acme: wherever possible there should be a one-to-one mapping between typical RL pseudocode and its implementation.

#### 2.2 Learners and Agents

#### We now introduce the learner component, which consumes training data in order to obtain a better policy. This component often contains the bulk of the code relevant to any specific RL algorithm and, in deep RL, takes the form of optimizing the weights of a neural network to minimize some algorithm-specific loss(es). More precise mathematical descriptions for a variety of algorithms will be detailed in Section 3. While it is possible to run a learner without further interaction with the environment, in RL `we are often interested in concurrent learning and acting`. Therefore we introduce `a special type of actor that includes both an acting and a learning component`; we refer to these as agents to distinguish them from their non-learning counterparts.

#### A generic actor’s update method simply pulls neural network weights from a variable source if it is provided one at initialization. Since a learner component is a valid variable source, the actor component may query a learner directly for its latest network weights. This will be particularly relevant when we discuss distributed agents in Section 2.4. 

#### In the following figure we again show the environment loop, where we have expanded the interaction to show the internals of a learning agent we just described. While redundant, we sometimes use the term `learning agent` to emphasize that the agent contains a learner component. The illustration includes the actor and learner components and depicts how they interact. In particular, the actor pulls weights from the learner components in order to keep its action-selection up-to-date. Meanwhile, the learner pulls experiences observed by the actor through a dataset, which is yet another important component.

#### 2.3 Datasets and Adders

#### While we have generally standardized on TensorFlow’s Dataset object to provide efficient buffering and iteration over data, this does not mandate（授权）the use of TensorFlow for the update step implemented by a learner. `The dataset itself is backed by a low-level data storage system, called Reverb`. Reverb can be roughly described as a storage system which enables efficient insertion and routing of items and a flexible sampling mechanism that allows: first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, uniform, and weighted sampling schemes.

#### `Acme also provides a simple common interface for insertion into the low-level storage system in the form of adders`. Adders provide add methods which are analogous to the observe methods found on an actor—in fact most actors’ observations are forwarded directly onto an adder object. These objects exist in order to allow for different styles of preprocessing and aggregation of observational data that occurs before insertion into the dataset. For example a given agent implementation might rely on sampling transitions, n-step transitions, sequences (overlapping or not), or entire episodes—all of which have existing adder implementations in Acme.

#### Relying on different adder implementations to carry the workload of adding data once it is observed has also allowed us to design very general actor modules that support a wide variety of learning agents. While any agent is able to implement its own internal actor—or indeed bypass its actor component entirely and implement its own acting/observing methods directly as an agent is an actor in its own right—most agents are able to use one of these standard actors. `Actors in Acme predominantly fall into one of two styles: feed-forward and recurrent`. As their names suggest, these actors primarily differ in how they maintain state (or do not) between calls to the action-selection method, and the exact form of network used for these actors must be passed in at construction. Note that in Acme we have also taken pains to `ensure that the communication between different components is agnostic（无关）to the underlying framework (e.g. TensorFlow) used`. However, as the actors themselves must interact directly with this framework we also provide different implementations for both TensorFlow and JAX—and similar accommodations could be made for other frameworks.

#### Given these different modules we can easily construct novel algorithms by varying one or more components. However, easily composing modules in order to create novel agents is not the primary purpose of these components. Instead, in the next section we will describe `how these modules can easily be pulled apart at the boundaries in order to enable distributed agents that can run at much larger scales`. 

#### 2.4 Distributed agents

#### A common use case is to generate data asynchronously from the learning process, often by interacting with multiple environments in parallel. In Acme `we accomplish this by splitting the acting, learning, and storage components introduced earlier into different threads or processes`. This has two benefits: 

- #### The first being that environment interactions can occur asynchronously with the learning process, i.e. we allow the learning process to proceed as quickly as possible regardless of the speed of data gathering. 

- #### The other benefit gained by structuring an agent in this way is that by making use of more actors in parallel we can accelerate the data generation process.

#### An example of a distributed agent is shown in the following figure.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/571.png"><br/>
</p>
#### By examining this figure we can see that this largely maintains the same structure introduced earlier. However, in the previous section links between different modules were used merely to indicate function calls. Instead, in the distributed variant each module is launched in its own process, where the links between different modules are now used to illustrate remote procedure calls (RPC). In the illustrated example this distributed agent consists of a data storage process, a learner process, and one or more distributed actors, each with their own environment loop. In order to simplify this construction, we also frequently use `an additional sub-module on the actor process: a variable client`. This serves purely to allow the actor to poll the learner for variable updates and simplifies the code (which is more cumbersome（累赘的）if the learner is required to push to every actor).

#### In this work we focus on describing the single-process variants of Acme agents. As a result, a full description of the distributed agents is somewhat out of scope. However, here we briefly describe the tool we have developed, Launchpad, which enables these distributed variants. The agents introduced in the previous section were themselves composed of different sub-modules, e.g. an actor, learner, and data storage system. In the same way, `Launchpad can be thought of as a mechanism for composing these modules in the distributed setting`. Roughly speaking, `Launchpad provides a mechanism for creating a distributed program as a graph consisting of nodes and edges`. Nodes exactly correspond to the modules—represented as class instances as described above—whereas the edges represent a client/server channel allowing communication between two modules. Once this graph has been constructed the program can then be launched to start its underlying computation. The key innovation of Launchpad is that `it handles the creation of these edges in such a way that from the perspective of any module there is no distinction between a local and remote communication`, e.g. for an actor retrieving parameters from a learner in both instances this just looks like a method call.

#### As a result, in what remains of this work we will `primarily describe either the individual modules, or their single-process combinations`. Our results, however, will show both single-process and distributed variants and in both cases the same underlying learning and acting code is being used. `We will leave a further detailed description of Launchpad for later work`.

#### 2.5 Reverb and rate limitation

#### In Acme observations are added to the replay buffer through the actor’s observe() method, which is called with each time step. Batches of transitions used to train the agent are then sampled from the buffer using the learner’s update() method. `Designing a replay buffer requires careful consideration regarding how to package experience into elementary items, how to sample these items, and how to remove them when the buffer is full`. With Reverb, these features are easily configured allowing the agent code to focus on what behaviour to use rather than how to achieve it.

#### In a synchronous learning loop, you may prescribe（指定）how many steps of acting in the environment your agent should perform between each learning steps. This ratio between acting and learning has a dramatic effect on not only the sample efficiency (the number of environment steps required to reach a given performance) but also the long-term learning performance and stability. `The same is true for distributed learning settings although this setting makes it more difficult to maintain a fixed ratio`. Indeed if distributing an agent is for the sake of computational efficiency, then it is clearly not desirable to block the learning process while the actor processes are gathering data. On the other hand, `running both processes independently easily results in higher variance`. The variance is often attributable to differences in the computational substrate (e.g. different hardware and network connectivity) between seeds but pinpointing precise sources can be extremely challenging.

#### `In Acme, these scaling issues are mitigated through the use of Reverb’s RateLimiter`. By adopting rate limitation, one can `enforce a desired relative rate of learning to acting`, allowing the actor and learner processes to run unblocked so long as they remain within some defined tolerance of the prescribed rate. In an ideal setting, both processes are given enough computational resource to run unblocked by the rate limiter. However if due to network issues, insufficient resources, or otherwise, one of the processes starts lagging behind the other, the rate limiter will block the latter while the former catches up. While this may waste computational resource by keeping the latter idle, it does so only for as long as is necessary to ensure the relative rate of learning to acting stays within tolerance.

#### Indeed the `replay buffer is a good place to enforce such a rate`. Notice that the first step in a learning process is to sample data from the dataset; similarly a key step in the environment loop (which runs on the actor processes) is to observe transitions and insert data into the dataset. Since both the learning and acting processes must communicate with the dataset component. If the learner is sampling experiences too quickly, the buffer blocks sampling requests until the actor catches up; if the actor(s) are inserting experiences too quickly, the buffer blocks insert requests until the learner catches up.

#### 2.6 Offline Agents

#### An additional benefit of the structuring we have taken for Acme agents is that it is trivial to apply any learning component to the offline setting, which assumes a fixed dataset of experiences that can be learned in a purely supervised manner. `In Acme this is as simple as applying a given learner module to a given dataset of experiences`. As there is a great deal of overlap between the pure batch setting and off-policy learning, many off-policy agents perform quite well and/or can be adapted to work when not allowed to interact with the environment. As we will describe in Section 3, however, agents purpose-built for this setting can have the edge when considering the underlying distribution of generated data. We defer any further discussion of this use-case to Section 3.7.
