### 1 Introduction

#### The agent-environment interaction in *AndroidEnv* matches that of a user and a real device: `the screen pixels constitute the observations, the action space is defined by touchscreen gestures`, the interaction is real-time, and actions are executed asynchronously, while the environment runs at its own time scale. 

### 2 Environment Features

#### *AndroidEnv* implements the *dm_env* API on top of an emulated Android device.

#### 2.1 Real-time execution

#### 2.2 Action interface

- #### Raw action space.

#### The native action space of the environment consists of a tuple consisting of a position (*x*, *y*) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1], determining the location of the action on the screen, and a discrete value *ActionType* ∈ {*TOUCH*, *LIFT*, *REPEAT*} indicating whether the agent opts for `touching the screen at the indicated location, lifting the pointer from the screen, or repeating the last chosen action`, respectively. This action space is the same across all tasks and apps.

#### It is worth noting that while two actions *a*1 = {*ActionType* = *LIFT*, *position* = (*x*1, *y*1)} and *a*2 = {*ActionType* = *LIFT*, *position* = (*x*2, *y*2)} are different from the agent’s perspective, in practice they result in `the same effect on the device`, because the *lack* of a touch has no association to a particular location.

- #### Gestures. 

#### The complexity of the interface arises from the fact that `individual raw actions on their own do not necessarily trigger a meaningful change in the environment`. It is more useful for agents to control Android applications via gestures, such as `pressing, long pressing, swiping, scrolling, or drag-and-drop`. Each of these correspond to a particular sequence of raw actions: for example, a screen touch at a particular location, followed by a lift of the the imaginary finger is a sequence that Android can interpret as a press of a button. Similarly, Android will interpret a sequence of aligned touches as scrolling.

#### This distinction between the raw action space and a particular app interface makes *AndroidEnv* a challenging domain. A random sequence of actions will typically have a small probability of producing a meaningful gesture in most Android apps. `This need to compose actions, paired with the difficulty of solving the underlying task itself, leads to a difficult exploration problem`. For example, in order to learn to play chess in *AndroidEnv*, an agent must not only find a winning strategy, it also has to learn to move pieces through drag-and-drop gestures.

- #### Relation to observations. 

#### Another notable feature of *AndroidEnv* is the `spatial correlation between actions and observations`. Often, an action can result in local changes in the pixels near the location of the action, or the position of certain items in the observation might hint at the next best location to take an action. In particular, the screen is often suggestive of the kind of gestures the application expects: smartphone users would often find it intuitive to tap where they see an item in the shape of a button, or to scroll where they see a drop-down menu.

- #### Altering the action space.

#### *AndroidEnv* allows users to `define wrappers around the raw action space of the environment`. For example, one might discretise the action space by splitting up the screen into a grid, restrict the *ActionType* to *TOUCH*, or group action sequences like [*LIFT*, *TOUCH*, *LIFT*] into a single tap action. We provide some useful and natural wrappers. Note that these wrappers alter the set of actions available to the agent, but not the way in which AndroidEnv interprets raw actions.

#### 2.3 Observations

- #### Observation space.

#### The observation space of *AndroidEnv* consists of `three main components`: {*pixels*, *timedelta*, *orientation*}. The most notable component is *pixels*, representing the current frame as an RGB image array. Its dimensions will depend on the device used (real or virtual), but given that it will correspond to real device screen sizes, this array will typically be large (of course, users can scale down their dimensionality, e.g. with wrappers). The *timedelta* component captures the amount of time passed since *AndroidEnv* fetched the last observation. The *orientation*, even though it does not affect the layout of the RGB image in the observation, might carry relevant information for the agent. For example, if there is text on the screen, its *orientation* is useful for automatic processing. 

#### As mentioned above, `observations often carry spatial cues（提示）and are suggestive of meaningful gestures to perform in a given state`. The fact that the observation space is the same across all tasks is what makes it useful for agents, and creates the opportunity to generalize across tasks.

- #### Task extras. 

#### In addition to default observations, `some tasks might expose structured information after each step`. An *extra* in *AndroidEnv* is any information that the environment sends to aid the understanding of the task. The information sent through this channel is typically `very useful for learning, yet difficult to extract from raw pixels`. For example, extras may include signals indicating events such as a button press or opening of a menu, text displayed on the screen in string format, or a simple numerical representations of the displayed state. Note that *extras* are a standard mechanism for communicating information used in Android apps.

#### We note that, unlike the observation and raw action space, which are the same across all *AndroidEnv*, `task extras are specific to individual tasks, are entirely optional, and may not be available at all`. Furthermore, task *extras*, even if provided, are not part of the default observation; rather *AndroidEnv* returns them upon explicit request.

### 3 Tasks

#### While Android is an operating system with no inherent rewards or episodes, *AndroidEnv* provides a simple mechanism for defining tasks on it. `Tasks capture information such as episode termination conditions, rewards, or the apps with which the agent can interact`. Together, these define a specific RL problem for the agent.

- #### Task structure. 

#### We capture aspects that make up a task definition in a *Task* protocol buffer message. These include information on:

1. #### `How to initialise the environment`: for example, installing particular applications on the device. 

2. #### `When should an episode be reset`: for example, upon receiving a particular message from the device or app, or upon reaching a certain time limit.

3. #### `Events triggered upon an episode reset`: for example, launching a given app, clearing the cache, or pinning the screen to a single app (hence restricting the agent’s interaction to that app).

4. #### `How to determine the reward`: for example, this might depend on different signals coming from Android, such as Android accessibility service or log messages implemented in applications.

#### With these protocol buffer messages, users can define a wide variety of tasks on Android. For example, `a task could be to set an alarm in the Android standard Clock app, by opening this app upon launch, and rewarding the agent and ending an episode once an alarm has been set`. We detail the full specification of the protocol buffer message structure in the code repository.

- #### Available tasks.

#### Along with the *AndroidEnv* platform implementation, we `provide an initial set of ready-to-use tasks`. At the time of the release, this includes over 100 tasks across roughly 30 different apps, ranging from basic tasks with straightforward objectives, to more sophisticated tasks that require long-term reasoning. The selection contains time-sensitive tasks (e.g. *catch*), physics-based environments (e.g. *vector_pinball*), puzzles (e.g. *classic_2048*), card games (e.g. *simple_solitaire*), spatial reasoning (e.g. *perfection*), UI navigation (e.g. *clock_set_timer*), strategy games (e.g. *droidfish*) and more. Note that several of these tasks are defined around the same app by varying parameters such as the game level, the reward signal or the difficulty. We emphasize that this set serves as a starting point and not as a definitive benchmark. Users can define their own tasks. We refer the reader to the code repository for instructions on creating additional tasks, as well as for an up-to-date list of available tasks.

### 7 Conclusion

#### Agents trained on the platform could potentially tackle a wide range of use cases leading to direct, real-world impact. For example, `the ability to automatically learn sequences of actions might lead to advanced hands-free voice navigation tools; on-device AI models could help provide a better user experience; and trained agents could assist in device testing and quality assurance by benchmarking new apps, measuring latency, or detecting crashes or unintended behaviours in the Android OS`.
